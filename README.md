### App Idea: Angel Archive

Angel Archive is a collector-focused platform designed to help users track, trade, and showcase their Sonny Angel collections. The app provides personalized features and fosters social engagement within the collector community. 

#### Features:
- **Collection Tracking**: Easily log and organize your Sonny Angel figures, with detailed views for each item in your collection.  
- **Trading Platform**: Connect with other collectors to trade figures and complete your collection.  
- **Showcase & Social Engagement**: Share your collection with others, discover new collectors, and engage with the community through likes, comments, and discussions.  

I am currently building a website version of Angel Archive and am excited to bring this concept to iOS in the future!
